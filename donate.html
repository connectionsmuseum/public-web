			<h2>Why donate to THG?</h2>
			<p>The Telecommunications History Group, Inc. is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization that depends on the support of generous individuals and organizations just like you. We are lucky to have a group of amazing volunteers, some retired telecommunications workers and some from related industries, but our organization still relies on fundraising to cover operational expenses, advertising, and expenses related to organizing and preserving collections.</p>
			<p>You can support Telecommunications History Group, or any of our three branches, by making a monetary donation below. You can also donate telecommunications equipment or historical documents, make an introduction, or donate your time!</p>

			<h2>Make a Monetary Donation</h2>
			<h4>We’re always looking for a few hours of help!</h4>
			<p>As in many non-profit organizations, the Telecommunications History Group’s volunteers are its life’s blood, keeping the group functioning and the archives in good order. Volunteers are essential to the building and maintenance of our archives, performing a variety of jobs, including archival and curator functions.</p>
			<p>Duties may include research, preservation, inventory, database entry and management, repair of antique equipment, tour conducting, educational speaking, and oral history collection. The work is performed at our Denver and Seattle locations.</p>
		</r-cell>
		<r-cell span=1>
			<h2>Donate Equipment or Historical Documents</h2>
			<p>You can utilize your existing knowledge or learn new skills
				There are opportunities to attend professional meetings and seminars
				Access to The Telecommunications History Group’s archive and collections
				You can participate in challenging work
				Potential to explore one aspect of archiving more deeply, or do something new each week
				Camaraderie with people of similar interests and background
				The satisfaction of helping to preserve the telecom heritage
				Note that telephone company experience is not required to become a THG volunteer!</p>

			<h2>Make an Introduction</h2>
			<p>Sometimes the most valuable resources are connections. At THG, we appreciate introductions to individuals or organizations who may be a good fit for current or future partnerships. Contact THG if you have someone in mind.</p>

		<r-cell span=1>
			<h2>Donate Your Time</h2>
			<p>THG depends on volunteers for a myriad of tasks and projects. If you have time to donate and are in the Denver or Seattle areas, let us know and we’d be happy to get you involved!</p>
