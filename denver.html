          Connections Museum Denver resides in a place of honor among telecom
          history locations. The 1929 Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph
          Company Headquarters building at 931 14th Street was deemed
          “Colorado’s Bell System Palace.” Finished shortly before the stock
          market crash of 1929, it represented a symbol of the power of industry
          and technology and has long been an important landmark in Denver.
        </p>
        <p>
          This museum is located on the prestigious 14th floor of the historic
          building, and shares the floor with the former executive offices from
          the phone company’s past. A private tour of the museum space includes
          a tour through the elegantly furnished executive offices and takes
          advantage of enjoying the impressive architecture and original murals
          created by famed Colorado artist Allen Tupper True.
        </p>

          Connections Museum Denver is open for tours. It is located within a
