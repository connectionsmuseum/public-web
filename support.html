        <h2>Why donate to the Connections Museum?</h2>
        <p>
          Our museum is an incredibly unique place. Our collection includes an
          unparalleled number of historically significant objects, many of which
          are either the only ones ever made, the last remaining in the entire
          world. In addition, we've been able to foster a large, diverse
          organization of intensely passionate volunteers who believe in the
          work we are doing, and who are able to ensure that all aspects of our
          mission are executed well. Our volunteers bring an expertise to the
          operations of our museums and archive, and also a bright future for
          years to come. If you're not quite sure what we're talking about,

          The Connections Museum is
          <a href="about.html#thg">a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization</a>
          that depends on the support of generous individuals and organizations
          just like you. We are lucky to have a group of amazing volunteers,
          some retired telecommunications workers and some from related
          industries, but our organization still relies on fundraising to cover
          operational expenses, advertising, and expenses related to organizing
          and preserving collections.

        <h2>Make an Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes the most valuable resources are <u>connections</u>. We
          appreciate introductions to individuals or organizations who may be a
          good fit for current or future partnerships, and interesting tours of
          industrial facilities (telecom-related or otherwise). Contact us at
          the donations email address above if you have someone in mind.

        <p>
          We have an extensive collection and a wide variety of telephone
          equipment, stations, phones, memorabilia, and other physical objects.
          If you have items to donate to the Connections Museum in Seattle or
          Denver, please contact us.

        <p>
          If you would like to donate artifacts to the Connections Museum
          Seattle, please send a description of the items (with pictures if at

          we still maintain an extensive collection of printed material related
          to the history of telephony, and especially technical material
          required for maintaining our equipment, which we try our best to make
          available to the broader telephone collector community.

          As in many non-profit organizations, our volunteers are our life

          archives in good order. Volunteers are essential to everything we do.

          Volunteer duties may include research, preservation, engineering,
          heavy-lifting, inventory, digitization, database entry and management,
          repair of antique equipment, tour conducting, educational speaking,
          and oral history collection. You'll have the option to explore one
          aspect of our collection more deeply, or do something new each week!
          Many of our volunteers are able to self-direct their own projects to
          improve our collections.

          We depend on volunteers for a myriad of tasks and projects. If you

          <li>You can utilize your existing knowledge or learn new skills.</li>

            our organization.
