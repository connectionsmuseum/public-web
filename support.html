        <h2>Why donate to THG?</h2>
        <p>
          The Telecommunications History Group, Inc. is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit
          organization that depends on the support of generous individuals and
          organizations just like you. We are lucky to have a group of amazing
          volunteers, some retired telecommunications workers and some from
          related industries, but our organization still relies on fundraising
          to cover operational expenses, advertising, and expenses related to
          organizing and preserving collections.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can support Telecommunications History Group, or any of our three
          branches, by making a monetary donation below. You can also donate
          telecommunications equipment or historical documents, make an
          introduction, or donate your time!

          Group’s volunteers are its life’s blood, keeping the group functioning

        <p>
          Sometimes the most valuable resources are connections. At THG, we
          appreciate introductions to individuals or organizations who may be a
          good fit for current or future partnerships. Contact THG if you have
          someone in mind.
