This project uses the grid-system and lightweight framework [Raster](https://rsms.me/raster/), which is open-source and [on Github here](https://github.com/rsms/raster).

It also uses the typeface [Jost\*](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) by the wonderful foundry Indestructible Type. It is available for our use under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org).
